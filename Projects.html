        <div class="item-content"><h1>My Game Projects</h1>
            <p>
		    Here's a collection of game projects in chronological order that I've been involved in developing during my education. They were made in small teams that usually inculded programmers, graphic artists, a designer and a producer. I've included short summaries of the projects and what I've done while developing them. If you would like to know more, I would love to talk about my experience and the skills I've aquired during these projects. You can find my contact information in one of the tabs above.

	<h1>Toy Thieves, PC</h1>
            <p>
		    Toy Thieves is an online Real Time Tactics game that utilizes Unity as it's game engine. The objective is to command an army of thief themed minions to rob toy themed valuables from the environment and the other players. The game was under development from January 2019 to December 2019 with the team working on it three days per week. The game never got published due to the school's publishing company making budget cuts and therefore not wanting to maintain a server that the game required to run online.
		    <br><br>
		    I worked as the programming lead in the Toy Thieves development team. Alongside managing the other programmers, I was responsible for the game's AI, pathfinding, procedural map generation, and most of the game logic e.g. winning conditions and round management.

		    <br><br>
		    The game was developed using Unity over two days by our 8-person team. I programmed the camera functionality and the game logic.

            <h1>Santa's Calendar Gift Throw, Android, Published on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TeamGrapplingHook.XmasGiftDelivery&hl=fi&gl=US">Google Play Store</a></h1>

The game is an endless runner game that gets increasingly faster. It also includes a christmas calendar that you can use to unlock different kinds of presents, chimneys and locations.
		    <br><br>
		    The game was developed using Unreal Engine 4. I worked as the programming lead in the project, managing other programmers and coding game mechanics e.g. aiming, throwing the presents and making different presents types such as a present that could be redirected once thrown.

		<h1>Tanks with Hands: Armed and Treaded, PC, Published on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/920580/Tanks_With_Hands_Armed_and_Treaded/">Steam</a></h1>
            <!--<img style="padding-left: 2px;
            " src="Content/image/TwH.jpg">-->

            <p>Tanks With Hands is a wacky local physics based brawler game. It was made using the Unity game engine and C#. I worked as a programmer in this project and was responsible for the game logic. This included managing levels, rounds and win conditions for the game as well as things like joining the game. I also developed some environmental hazards for the game like the fences and cars that might veer off of a race track that is near the players in one of the maps. The development period was three months, five days a week, and eight hours per day in the Summer of 2018 and the team consisted of eight people.
		    <br><br>
		    Tanks with Hands won first place in the Assembly 2018 Hatch Party Game Competition and second place in the Assembly 2018 Game Development Competition during its Alpha development. The game was released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/920580/Tanks_With_Hands_Armed_and_Treaded/">Steam</a> at the end of the Summer.

            <h1>Tapper Studio, Android</h1>
            <p>Tapper Studio is a simple mobile clicker game with a small twist on the genre. The goal of the game is to create music albums and songs by tapping the instruments on the game (a piano, drums, and a guitar). Contrary to usual clicker games however, Tapper Studio awards the player for other things as well as just mindless clicking. The player can create combos by switching between instruments and keeping up the tempo for all of them. All the instruments also have some sort of gimmick to them, like the guitar having Guitar Hero -esque notes that flow down from the top of the screen that you have to tap as they reach the bottom. The game also has an in-game shop where you can buy upgrades and skins for your instruments. 
        	<br><br>
		Tapper Studio was developed using Unity as the game engine and C# as the coding language. The development was a two-month period where our 5-person team worked on the game one day per week. I was responsible for programming the guitar, the random album and song name generators, and a part of the shop.
            </p>
		<h1>Snake Warriors, PC</h1>
            <p>Snake Warriors is basically a multiplayer version of old school snake but with power-ups and the ability to cut the opponents tail by eating through it. The goal is to grow to a large enough size to win the game.
        	<br><br>
		Snake Warriors was developed using Unity as the game engine and C# as the coding language. The development was a two-month period where our 3-person team worked on the game one day per week. I was responsible for programming some of the power-ups, random map generation, and spawning.
