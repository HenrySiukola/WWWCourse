	<h1>Toy Thieves</h1>
            <p>
		    Toy Thieves is a Real Time Tactics game that utilized Unity as it's game engine. The objective is to command an army of thief themed minions to rob valuables from the environment and the other players. I worked as the programming lead in the Toy Thieves development team. Alongside managing the other programmers, I was responsible for the AI and pathfinding of the game. I've also developed most of the game logic e.g. winning conditions and round management.

            <h1>Santa's Calendar Gift Throw</h1>
            <p>
		    Santa's Calendar Gift Throw is a christmas themed mobile game where the player assumes the role of Santa and delivers presents to people by throwing them down chimneys as he passes by. The game is an endless runner game that gets increasingly faster. It also includes a christmas calendar that you can use to unlock different kinds of presents, chimneys and locations. The game was developed using Unreal Engine 4. I worked as the programming lead in the project, managing other programmers and coding game mechanics e.g. aiming, throwing the presents and making different presents types such as a present that could be redirected once thrown.
