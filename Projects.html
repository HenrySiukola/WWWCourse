	<h1>Toy Thieves</h1>
            <p>
		    Toy Thieves is an online Real Time Tactics game that utilizes Unity as it's game engine. The objective is to command an army of thief themed minions to rob toy themed valuables from the environment and the other players. The game was under development from January 2019 to December 2019 with the team working on it three days per week. The game never got published due to the school's publishing company making budget cuts and therefore not wanting to maintain a server that the game required to run online.
		    <br>
		    I worked as the programming lead in the Toy Thieves development team. Alongside managing the other programmers, I was responsible for the game's AI, pathfinding, procedural map generation, and most of the game logic e.g. winning conditions and round management.

            <p>Tanks With Hands is a wacky local physics based brawler game. It was made using the Unity game engine. I worked as a programmer in this project and was responsible for the game logic. This included managing levels, rounds and win conditions for the game as well as things like joining the game. The development period was three months in the Summer of 2018 and the team consisted of eight people.
		    <br>
		    Tanks with Hands won first place in the Assembly 2018 Hatch Party Game Competition and second place in the Assembly 2018 Game Development Competition during its Alpha development. The game was released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/920580/Tanks_With_Hands_Armed_and_Treaded/">Steam</a> at the end of the Summer.

            <h1>Santa's Calendar Gift Throw</h1>
            <p>
		    Santa's Calendar Gift Throw is a christmas themed mobile game where the player assumes the role of Santa and delivers presents to people by throwing them down chimneys as he passes by. The game is an endless runner game that gets increasingly faster. It also includes a christmas calendar that you can use to unlock different kinds of presents, chimneys and locations.
		    <br>
		    The game was developed using Unreal Engine 4. I worked as the programming lead in the project, managing other programmers and coding game mechanics e.g. aiming, throwing the presents and making different presents types such as a present that could be redirected once thrown.
