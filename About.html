			<h1>General</h1>
		<p>I was born and raised in Central Finland in a city called Jyväskylä. </p>
			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<p>
			I like to spend my free time by exercising, playing games or reading. When it comes to sports, I especially enjoy anything that requires fast-paced movement and good motor skills. Parkour in the Summer and snowboarding in the Winter are two of my favorites but I'll gladly join any other activity when asked. I also tend to hit the gym once in a while or go for a jog while listening to a good podcast or an audiobook.
			<br> 
			When you're a game developer, playing games comes with the territory. I'll play almost any video or board game but my favorites usually involve some combination of strategy, tactics, creativity, expansive storytelling, exploration, and playing with or against other players. Some of the games I've really enjoyed over the years include things like chess, Halo, Hollow Knight, League of Legends, and Portal. My current obsession is Dungeons and Dragons which I run for a group of my friends about once a week. The collaborative storytelling of the game combined with the randomness of dice rolls always creates new and interesting situations.
			<br>
			Speaking of storytelling, I also enjoy reading. Again, anything goes, but fantasy and science fiction have always been close to my heart. I'm currently rereading Dune by Frank Herbert because of the new movie based on the first half of the book.
