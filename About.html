			<h1Henry Siukola's Portfolio</h1>
		    <p>Thank you for viewing my portfolio! I recently graduated from Kajaani University of Applied Sciences with a bachelor's degree on business administration focusing on game programming and design. This portfolio is meant to showcase some of the things I accomplished and created during my studies. It's made with HTML, CSS and javascript and hosted on GitHub.</p>
